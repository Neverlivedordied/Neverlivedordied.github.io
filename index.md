discord in development
### canceling the discord server


### I am no longer using discord for server I am using gilded so here are some pro and cons
GILDED VS DISCORD
GILDED: no need for a "nitro" to use animtaed emojis and bigger upload size with out a sub, a sub to a server and you make make the price aka you make the tiers whats in it and how much it costs 
Discord need a sub for animated emojis, bigger file size, and fixed price for sub 

I orginally intneded on having a discord server though in order to be unique guilded is better also phone verification kinda thrown me to it though thats done now so ye
